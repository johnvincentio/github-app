# Coding Challenge Guidelines

Please organize, design, test, document and deploy your code as if it were going into <strong>production</strong>, then send us a link to the hosted repository (e.g. Github, Bitbucket...).

## Functional spec

Create an application that allows for a user to search for a GitHub username.

On a successful search return, display:

* the user's GitHub handle, 
* follower count, 
* a list of the user's followers (just the avatar is fine). 

Since some users (e.g. mrdoob, holman, etc.) have many thousands of followers, GitHub only returns a portion of the followers with each request.

Create a "load more" button that, when clicked, fetches the next payload of followers. This button should persist until there are no more pages of followers to fetch.

The UX/UI is totally up to you. If you like, get creative and add additional features a user might find useful!

## Technical spec

The front-end should ideally be a single page app with a single index.html linking to external JS/CSS/etc. Please take take this opportunity to demonstrate your CSS3 and HTML5 knowledge.

Please use ReactJS to complete the coding challenge

## Host it!

When youâ€™re done, host it somewhere (e.g. on Amazon EC2, Heroku, Google AppEngine, etc.).
